Restrict Content is a powerful WordPress membership plugin that gives you full control over who can and cannot view content on your WordPress site.

== Description ==
Restrict Content is a powerful WordPress membership plugin that allows you to monetize content access. As a content restriction plugin, Restrict Content gives you full control over who can and cannot view content on your WordPress site. As a design tool, Restrict Content helps you create pages that dynamically display content based on user role or membership level.

Restrict Content can power a full-fledged membership or subscription website with multiple membership levels, or just hide a page or post. Restrict Content makes it simple to limit access to posts, pages, media, custom post types, and even API requests. This gives you full control over who can and who cannot view content on your WordPress site.

= 🛠 Developer Features =

Restrict Content Pro has been built with developers in mind. That means it is flexible, easy to extend, and chocked full of action hooks and filters, making it easy to modify and tweak to your specific needs. With clean and simple display options, Restrict Content Pro is designed to integrate perfectly with every theme without any custom CSS being necessary.

Extensive and easy to modify template files are included with Restrict Content Pro. If you have built a theme, for clients or general distribution, you can easily customize the display of registration forms, profile editor, account pages, and more through custom template files added directly to your theme’s folder.

Because of the huge number of action hooks and filters, Restrict Content Pro can be easily integrated with other plugins to help provide a more seamless experience for customers. This also makes it possible to build add-on plugins for Restrict Content Pro that extend its functionality.

✔️ Theme Integration - Designed to work with any theme.
✔️ Action Hooks & filters galore - Restrict Content contains a bunch of action hooks and filters, allowing you to easily customize the plugin to your specific needs. Check out our extensive developer docs for actions, filters, classes, constants, and functions.
✔️ Easy to Modify Template files - Making changes to Restrict Content Pro template files is a cinch. Make a copy of any plugin template file and drop it in your theme to override the plugin’s file with your own custom markup.
✔️ So Many Integrations - Restrict Content plays nice with a bunch of plugins and third-party services, including e-commerce systems like WooCommerce, lots of Pro payment gateways, email newsletter services, and much more!
✔️ REST API - Restrict Content Pro includes a complete REST API, allowing you to extend the plugin and its functionality beyond WordPress and into your web application. The possibilities for what you can do are nearly limitless!
✔️ WP-CLI Integration - Restrict Content Pro integrates with WP-CLI. Several commands are supported in order to speed up your workflow with batch processing jobs, creating memberships, and viewing customer information.
✔️ Debug mode for developers - Turn on error logging to help identify issues. Logs are kept in Restrict > Tools.

= 💳 Stripe payment processing support =

It’s no secret that we believe [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is the best payment processor. Stripe currently supports 14 languages, over 35 countries and 135+ currencies. [Check support for your country](https://stripe.com/global).

Hands down, Stripe has the simplest setup process and highest reliability we know of – and support for Stripe is included in Restrict Content. Stripe has a per-transaction charge which varies by country. See [Stripe’s pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing) for more information. However, if you prefer a different payment gateway or your country does not support Stripe, we’ve got you covered...

Besides Stripe, we have several payment gateways available to Restrict Content Pro. Visit the following links to get more details for the payment gateway of your choice.

Check out our [getting started guide](https://help.ithemes.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402387794587-Getting-Started-with-Restrict-Content) for help with settings and features.

To restrict an entire post or page, simply select the user level or membership level you’d like to restrict the post or page to from the drop down menu added just below the post/page editor.

There is also a short code for showing content only to users that are not logged in.

[not_logged_in]This content is only shown to non-logged-in users.[/not_logged_in]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I just restrict part of a post/page? =

Yes. You can choose exactly which content to protect with the [restrict] shortcode. You can set the `userlevel` attribute to specify which role is required to view the content. For example, to restrict to editors you would use: `[restrict userlevel=”editor”]Your protected content here.[/restrict]`

= Can I charge customers when they register an account? =

Yes! With the Restrict Content plugin, you can offer paid membership levels with manual payments or Stripe. For even more payment gateways, check out [Restrict Content Pro](https://restrictcontentpro.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=faq).

= Does the plugin protect images and other media files? =

Yes. Restrict Content can restrict access to media that is embedded within a post or page, but it does not protect the original file URL on the server.

= Can I restrict content in my RSS feed? =

Yes. There’s a checkbox for this within each post/page. If enabled, that content in your RSS feed will be restricted.

= Can I integrate newsletter signups with the registration form? =

Not with this plugin, but [Restrict Content Pro](https://restrictcontentpro.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=faq) has integrations for many popular email marketing providers, including Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, and more.

= Do restrictions work in REST API requests? =

Yes. All restrictions apply in REST API requests - exactly the same as if viewing your site normally.

= Does Restrict Content work with the Gutenberg editor / the WordPress block editor? =

Yes. Full page restriction settings as well as the `[restrict]`, `[register_form]`, and `[login_form]` shortcodes all work with Gutenberg.

= Does this plugin support restricting access by custom user roles? =

Yes! Restrict Content provides the ability to limit access based on custom roles.

= Will the plugin work with third party page builders? =

Restrict Content works with most third party page builders. However, if using the [restrict] shortcode, most page builders will require that the opening and closing shortcode tags be within the same element/block.

= Does this plugin include frontend login or registration forms? =

Yes. Restrict Content includes shortcodes for a registration form, a login form, and a password reset form.
