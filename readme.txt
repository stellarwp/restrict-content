Running a membership site on WordPress doesn't have to be difficult. With Restrict Content you can limit access to exclusive content in minutes.

== Description ==

It should be _easy_ to create a membership site! That’s why we created **Restrict Content**, a simple membership plugin that enables you to restrict access based on user role so that your posts or pages become viewable by logged-in members only. This gives you full control over who can and who cannot view content on your WordPress site.

With over 10,000 active installs, Restrict Content is one of the most popular membership plugins for WordPress. Restrict Content makes it simple to limit access to posts, pages, media, custom post types, and even API requests.

With Restrict Content to create your membership site, you’ll be able to:

- Protect sensitive content
- Control user access
- Collect emails
- Allow new users to self register
- Clearly separate public content from private content
- Restrict access to entire pages or specific sections
- Let users register and login from the frontend of your site

And if all that is not enough, there’s also a pro version which you can easily upgrade to which enables even more membership features.

> An excellent plugin. I didn’t think that it would work out of the box as well as it did – very little configuration required. It just works – brilliantly.

= Restrict Content features =

- Limit access to content with a shortcode. Example: `[restrict]This content is limited to logged in users.[/restrict]`
- Limit access to content based on user role. Example: `[restrict userlevel="editor"]Only editors and higher can see this content.[/restrict]`
- Limit access to full content via a simple interface on the post, page, and custom post type editing screens.
- Display a registration form for new accounts on any page of your website with `[register_form]`.
- Display a login form for existing users on any page of your website with `[login_form]`.
- Specify the message shown to users who don't meet the role requirement.
- Optionally hide content in RSS feeds.

> I have been using this plugin on multiple websites for restricting visitors from accessing membership-like pages. It has worked exactly as it is described to. It was very simple to set up and get working. I highly recommend this plugin if you are looking for something to restrict content.

**[Upgrade to Restrict Content Pro now](https://restrictcontentpro.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=upgrade&utm_term=description)**

Read more details about the features Restrict Content Pro has to offer:

= Complete membership management =

Restrict Content Pro lets you easily keep track of your memberships through an intuitive admin interface. Quickly view active, expired, cancelled, and pending memberships.

Memberships can be added manually, modified in bulk, and easily searched for when you need to locate a specific record. Each membership can also be manually modified at any time.

= Unlimited membership levels =

Restrict Content Pro allows site administrators to create any number of membership levels that customers can register for. Membership level options are displayed on the registration page and customers can select the one they wish to purchase.

For each membership level, you can:

- Set any price (including free)
- Optionally set a sign up fee
- Optionally set a trial period
- Set the frequency and period
- Specify a user role that will be assigned to members when they register

Customers can also upgrade and downgrade between membership levels at any time. These upgrades and downgrades are prorated based on how much the customer has already paid and how much time is left in their current membership.

= Stripe payment processing support =

It’s no secret that we believe [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is the best payment processor. Stripe currently supports 14 languages, over 35 countries and 135+ currencies. [Check support for your country](https://stripe.com/global).

Hands down, Stripe has the simplest setup process and highest reliability we know of – and support for Stripe is included in Restrict Content Pro. Stripe has a per-transaction charge which varies by country. See [Stripe’s pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing) for more information.

However, if you prefer a different payment gateway or your country does not support Stripe, we’ve got you covered...

= Other payment gateway integrations =

Besides Stripe, we have several payment gateways available to Restrict Content Pro site owners. Visit the following links to get more details for the payment gateway of your choice.

- [PayPal](https://restrictcontentpro.com/tour/payment-gateways/paypal/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=paypal&utm_term=description)
- [Authorize.Net](https://restrictcontentpro.com/tour/payment-gateways/authorize-net/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=authorize-net&utm_term=description)
- [Braintree](https://restrictcontentpro.com/tour/payment-gateways/braintree/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=braintree&utm_term=description)
- [2Checkout](https://restrictcontentpro.com/tour/payment-gateways/2checkout/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=2checkout&utm_term=description)
- [Build your own (extensive API available)](https://restrictcontentpro.com/tour/payment-gateways/add-your-own/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=add-your-own&utm_term=description)

= WooCommerce integration =

Restrict Content Pro allows you to easily control who can view and/or purchase products in [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/), the most popular eCommerce plugin for WordPress.

= Self-service account management =

Restrict Content Pro includes a complete customer dashboard that allows members to manage their account.

Members can easily view their account status, renewal or expiration date, and options to upgrade or cancel their account. They can also access a complete history of payments made to their account including invoices for each payment.

Finally, members are able update their account name, email, and password through an included profile editor.

= Prorated upgrades and downgrades =

Your membership site can have any number of membership levels and customers can upgrade and downgrade between those membership levels whenever they wish. If a customer chooses to upgrade or downgrade, their new purchase will be prorated based on what they have already paid and how much time is left in their current membership.

= Export data to CSV =

We firmly believe and stand behind the philosophy of owning your own data. For this reason, all data stored in Restrict Content Pro can be easily exported to a CSV file.

Whether you prefer to maintain your own records of your memberships database, you wish to run your own analysis, or you simply need to import membership records into another service or application, such as MailChimp or Excel, Restrict Content Pro allows you to export all membership records to a CSV at anytime.

Transaction history can also be easily exported to a CSV file, letting you then import the payment data into Excel, QuickBooks, or any other accounting software that can process a CSV file.

= Offer discount codes to customers =

Discount codes allow you to provide your customers with special promotional codes that give them a discount on the purchase of a membership.

Restrict Content Pro supports various kinds of discount codes and site administrators can easily create any number of discounts from the admin interface. Discount codes can be set up to provide a percentage discount or a flat rate discount. Each discount code is created with a name, description, unique code, maximum uses, and optional expiration dates.

= Email members membership updates =

Keeping your customers informed about their membership is highly important for membership websites. Restrict Content Pro includes a number of automatic emails that can be configured to be delivered when a customer’s membership is updated.

These emails are configured by the site administrator and can be sent during the following events:

- New paid membership is activated
- New free membership is activated
- New trial membership is activated
- Membership is cancelled
- Membership has expired
- Membership is expiring soon
- Membership is renewing soon
- Renewal payment is received
- Renewal payment failed

Each of the emails can be configured independently.

= Detailed reporting =

Restrict Content Pro provides a complete reports section where you can view the earnings of your membership website. You can view total earnings for any given period or drill down to specific membership levels.

Additional reports include account registrations over time and complete transaction tracking of all membership payments.

= Member approval workflow =

Many membership sites want to strictly control which members get access to premium content. Restrict Content Pro offers a direct integration with [WP Approve User](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-approve-user/), giving site administrators the ability to moderate member registration.

After a member’s account is registered, administrators will be given an option to Approve the account. Only once the account is approved can members access premium content. If a member’s account needs to be disabled, an Un-approve option is available.

= Email marketing service provider add-ons =

With a Professional or higher license, you can connect Restrict Content Pro to any of the following email marketing service providers. This allows you to add members to your mailing lists for different membership levels as well as synchronize account details.

= Developer-friendly =

Restrict Content Pro has been built with developers in mind. That means it is flexible, easy to extend, and chalked full of action hooks and filters, making it easy to modify and tweak to your specific needs.

With clean and simple display options, Restrict Content Pro is designed to integrate perfectly with every theme without any custom CSS being necessary.

Extensive and easy to modify template files are included with Restrict Content Pro. If you have built a theme, for clients or general distribution, you can easily customize the display of registration forms, profile editor, account pages, and more through custom template files added directly to your theme’s folder.

Because of the huge number of action hooks and filters, Restrict Content Pro can be easily integrated with other plugins to help provide a more seamless experience for customers. This also makes it possible to build add-on plugins for Restrict Content Pro that extend its functionality. See our [developer docs](https://docs.restrictcontentpro.com/collection/1493-developer-docs?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=dev-docs&utm_term=description) and [code snippet library](https://github.com/restrictcontentpro/library) for more.

== Installation ==

1. Upload restrict-content to wp-content/plugins
2. Click "Activate" in the WordPress plugins menu
3. Go to Settings > Restrict Content and customize the Message settings
4. Follow instructions below to restrict content

To restrict an entire post or page, simply select the user level you’d like to restrict the post or page to from the drop down menu added just below the post/page editor.

To restrict just a section of content within a post or page, you may use shortcodes like this:

[restrict userlevel="editor"] . . . your restricted content goes here . . . [/restrict]

Accepted userlevel values are:
 * admin
 * editor
 * author
 * subscriber
 * contributor

There is also a short code for showing content only to users that are not logged in.

[not_logged_in]This content is only shown to non-logged-in users.[/not_logged_in]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I just restrict part of a post / page? =

Yes. You can choose exactly which content to protect with the [restrict] shortcode. You can set the `userlevel` attribute to specify which role is required to view the content. For example, to restrict to editors you would use: `[restrict userlevel=”editor”]Your protected content here.[/restrict]`

= Can I charge customers when they register an account? =

Not with this plugin, but we do offer a [Pro version](https://restrictcontentpro.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=faq) that does include full support for charging for memberships and integrating with Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net, and more.

= Does the plugin protect images and other media files? =

Yes. Restrict Content can restrict access to media that is embedded within a post or page, but it does not protect the original file URL on the server.

= Can I restrict content in my RSS feed? =

Yes. There’s a checkbox for this within each post/page. If enabled, that content in your RSS feed will be restricted.

= Can I integrate newsletter signups with the registration form? =

Not with this plugin, but the [Pro version](https://restrictcontentpro.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=faq) has integrations for many popular email marketing providers, including Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, and more.

= Do restrictions work in REST API requests? =

Yes. All restrictions apply in REST API requests - exactly the same as if viewing your site normally.

= Does Restrict Content work with the Gutenberg editor? =

Yes. Full page restriction settings as well as the `[restrict]`, `[register_form]`, and `[login_form]` shortcodes all work with Gutenberg.

= Does this plugin support restricting access by custom user roles? =

Not with this plugin, but the [Pro version](https://restrictcontentpro.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=faq) provides the ability to limit access based on custom roles.

= Will the plugin work with third party page builders? =

Restrict Content works with most third party page builders. However, if using the [restrict] shortcode, most page builders will require that the opening and closing shortcode tags be within the same element/block.

= Does this plugin include frontend login or registration forms? =

Yes. Restrict Content includes shortcodes for a registration form, a login form, and a password reset form.
